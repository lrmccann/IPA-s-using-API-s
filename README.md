## IPA's using API's
Collaborating with a team of three, we created a simple application using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and third party API’s. We set out to create a sleek, user friendly, way to search local IPA friendly places in your city. Grabbing a quick drink has never been as crucial for a person’s sanity as it is right now!
